# ITSE_2359_Week13

Couldn't add audio to this recording, sorry. I was travelling when I made it and didn't have a pc mic.

Main issue with the code is there isn't a current way to delete all saved data and start the list over so it sort of just builds.
That's why the video includes data from my testing I did before the recording started.
